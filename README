WARNING: As far as I know, this package works correctly.  However,
don't make the mistake of considering it anything more than an alpha
release!

# RECENT CHAN@ES #
##################


** 01-27-98 RELEASE 0.06

- Exceptional/fatal cases are ignored by default, but can be enabled
with a command line switch (-f).

- Fixed: C++ support and stats overlap.

- Added a patch for Makefile.PLs.


** 01-20-98 RELEASE 0.05

- Moved Test::Harness and Test to the ./maybe directory.  They are no
longer installed by default.

- Fixed overlap report: sort by uniqueness instead of sameness &
average by test, not by file.


** 01-13-98 RELEASE 0.04

- General integration with Test::Harness.

- Initially targeted at the perl core.  See the ./patch directory.

- Coverage analyzer is housed within an interactive perl shell.

- Test::Harness: added a new category of tests.  A test script can
output a list of tests that it expects will fail.  If these tests
fail, they will be accepted as 'ok'.  The twist is that if they
succeed, they are listed under a new 'bonus' category.  (I.e. Known
bugs :-)

- Test.pm: A simple module to make writing tests a little easier.
